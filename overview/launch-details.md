## What To Expect

This expansion is a strategic move that aims to generate new revenue opportunities for Scale.farm.

Our key goal is to build a sustainable future leveraging the power of L2 technology, building upon our current success and community.

## Why BASE

The decision to expand to BASE Chain is not a random choice. The BASE Chain comes with a list of opportunities that we believe are beneficial for our users and platform. Here’s why we’re excited:

* BASE is a Layer 2 solution that has gained significant attention from the crypto community. Its ambitious goal of becoming the leading Layer 2 with the backing of Coinbase, providing a foundation of stability for our expansion.

* We see the potential for BASE to become the industry’s leading Layer 2 solution. We believe being part of this journey will provide immense opportunities for our users.

* Utilizing the OP Technology Stack, Base Chain presents a unique advantage for our expansion. This technology stack has proven efficient and reliable, which aligns with our commitment to offer our community the best experiences in DeFi.

## The Launch Liquidity Sequence

Our launch on Base Chain will be executed in a phased manner to ensure stability and safety. Here’s how the liquidity sequence will unfold:

1. Initial Liquidity Pool Setup: We’ll set up the initial liquidity pool with a combination of SCALE and ETH. This will serve as the primary source for purchasing SCALE.
2. SCALE Swap Fees: We will be setting up our liquidity pool to have a time reducing fee structure. Trade Fees on SCALE/ETH pair will start at 99% Fees and slowly be ramped down to 2% over the first 60 minutes of launch.
3. Expansion of Pairs: As the ecosystem grows, we’ll introduce more trading pairs based on market dynamics.
